    <h1>Home:</h1>
    <p><img src="../../../Assets/Screenshot 2025-06-16 140045.png" alt="" align="right" width="300"><b>Saylani Welfare Trust</b> is one of Pakistan’s most respected and impactful charitable organizations. It was established in 1999 by <b>"Maulana Bashir Farooq Qadri"</b> with the mission to serve humanity, regardless of race, religion, or background. The Trust began by feeding a small number of people daily and has now grown to serve over 100,000 meals every day. Its Dastarkhwan (free meal program) is one of the largest in South Asia, helping to fight hunger on a massive scale.

In addition to food, Saylani Welfare provides free healthcare through clinics, hospitals, and mobile units. Patients receive treatment, medicines, and even surgeries without any cost. The organization also runs blood banks and offers diagnostic services to the poor. In the field of education, Saylani has launched schools, computer institutes, and skill development programs. Thousands of students benefit from modern education, vocational training, and IT courses that prepare them for the job market.

Saylani’s Rozgar (employment) program helps people start small businesses with interest-free loans and resources. They also assist widows, orphans, and the elderly with monthly financial aid. During emergencies like floods, earthquakes, and pandemics, the Trust provides immediate relief, including food packs, shelter, and medical aid. Their clean water projects ensure that safe drinking water reaches remote and underserved areas.

With a strong network of volunteers and donors, Saylani Welfare continues to grow and expand its services nationally and internationally. It stands as a beacon of hope, kindness, and humanity for millions in need. Through its efforts, Saylani is transforming lives and building a more compassionate society, one act of kindness at a time.</p>

<h2>It Free Courese:</h2>
<p><b>Saylani Welfare Trust</b> is playing a vital role in empowering the youth of Pakistan through its free IT courses. Understanding the growing importance of digital skills, Saylani launched the Saylani Mass IT Training Program to equip students with modern and in-demand technologies. These courses include Web Development, App Development, Graphic Design, Data Science, Cloud Computing, and more. Thousands of students from underprivileged backgrounds are gaining access to high-quality IT education without any cost. The goal is to prepare them for freelancing, remote jobs, and tech careers both locally and globally. Saylani also provides career counseling, job placement assistance, and mentorship to help students succeed in the competitive digital world. Many graduates have already started earning online and supporting their families. This initiative is not just teaching skills—it is breaking the cycle of poverty through knowledge and opportunity. Saylani’s IT program is a true example of how education can change lives.</p>
